# GA WDI-34  Project #2: A Full-stack Application

Stylist No1 Hair App inspiration is designed to enable hairdressers and stylist to showcase their portfolio of work. The app includes information about them and the salon they work at as well as the pictures of the work they have performed on their existing clients.

This project was completed using Node JS, Mongo database using Mongoose ORM, Bulma and Sass for styling this enabled me to build a full-stack RESTful application which included authentication.

#### App development

Created 3 models which included Users, portfolio and picture. Application is fully functioning and able to do all RESTful requirements.


#### planned features

Achieved the main requirements to showcase images for hairstyles however I would like to aim to add additional features including
- An input field to include the name and email of the person who leaves a comment - currently not active
- Star rating system  
- Google maps as an API
- Booking system
- Information on the styles of hair
- feature a search button to enable clients to search for what look they would like to achieve.
