# GA WDI-34  Project #2: A Full-stack Application

As part of the WDI programme, our second deliverable was to build our first full-stack RESTful authenticated app using Node.JS, ESJ and MongoDB.

I chose built a Hairstylist app, designed to enable hairdressers and barbers to showcase their portfolio of work. The app includes information about them and the salon they work from, as well as the pictures of the work they have performed on their existing clients.

#### The build

In order to reach MVP my target was to create a route for hairdressers to login and upload pictures of their current hairstyles and information about themselves. To achieve this I created 3 models Users, Portfolio and Picture.



#### planned features

Achieved the main requirements to showcase images for hairstyles however I would like to aim to add additional features including
- An input field to include the name and email of the person who leaves a comment - currently not active
- Star rating system  
- Google maps as an API
- Booking system
- Information on the styles of hair and feature a search button to enable clients to search for what look they would like to achieve.
<!-- - "add a picture" link to only show up on the hairdressers login page -->
<!-- - about page -->
- like and follow
- search
